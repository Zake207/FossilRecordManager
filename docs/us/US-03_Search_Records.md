User Story

As a user
I want to search my records using filters
so that I can quickly find specific species or entries.

Acceptance Criteria

 Users can only search within their own private records.

 Records can be filtered by:

 species name

 creation date

 tags (if implemented later)

 Results are ordered by date or title.

 A message appears when no results are found.

 Filters can be combined.

 The search feature is fast and responsive.
