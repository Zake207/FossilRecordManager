User Story

As a user
I want to upload images to my records
so that I can add visual documentation to my notes.

Acceptance Criteria

 Users can upload one or multiple images when creating or editing a record.

 Images are stored securely (e.g., in Supabase Storage).

 File type and size are validated (jpg, png, webp, etc.).

 Image URLs are linked to the record in the database.

 Deleting a record also deletes its linked images from storage.

 A preview/thumbnail is shown before saving.
